 plugin de wordpress para un doble slider tipo galer√≠a

This plugin is a custom made project for a customer that wanted a grid gallery slider, and if you click in any of the images
you will we a pop up showing a second slide with more images that corrresponds for the one image clicked first.

so here is a screenshot of the first image (please ignore the images are just for test, but if you add some goog images it will look very good)

i just want to add that this works with any theme and with any builder, no restrictions at all.

and it is builded with bootstrap, css, javascript, jquery php and swiper for the slides.

So enjoy that plugin
